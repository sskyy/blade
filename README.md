Blade  V0.0.1
==============

**This plugin currently only work for Sketch beta 3.0.2(7779). This version is unstable now, and may crash due to Sketch [memory issue](https://github.com/tisho/sketch-plugins/issues/2#issuecomment-44082938). You may need at least 3GB free memory to generate HTML for complicate sketch resource file.**

##What is blade?##

Blade is a Sketch 3 plugin for automatically HTML generating. It will generate tag `<div>` for group, tag `<p>` for text , etc. 

##Any amazing features?##

I uploaded a demo sketch file and the generated HTML files which shows some magic. Have a quick look here:

###My sketch file:

<img width= "100%" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sskyy/blade/master/demo/1.png"/>

###Generated HTML:

<img  width= "100%" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sskyy/blade/master/demo/2.png"/>

###When you press `shift` key:

<img  width= "100%" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sskyy/blade/master/demo/3.png"/>

###Keep `shift` pressed down and click the `red` tab, you will get:###

<img  width= "100%" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sskyy/blade/master/demo/4.png"/>

Yes, the tag `[case=red]` on the sketch group will help you generate a interactive HTML files.

##What's next?##

I will continue write magic tags for blade, and tring to integrate AngularJS to help build better prototype。
